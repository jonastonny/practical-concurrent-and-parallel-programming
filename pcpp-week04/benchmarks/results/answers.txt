4.1.1
	Our results are very much like the ones in 'Microbenchmarks'.
	Most results seems plausible based on the 'Microbencharks'-specifications.
	No significant surprises where found, though we did reach the 16777216 count
	in Mark6.

4.1.2
	Our results are very much like the ones in 'Microbenchmarks'.
	In the case of the 'log' calculation, we reached a higher count on both machines, compared to the one in 'Microbenchmarks'. Other than that, the results were as expected.

4.2.1
	We conductet the tests on two machines, a Mac and a Windows (see specs in seperate files). On the Windows machine we had some strangenesses in the time consumed during the 512-count in the hashCode benchmark, where it used significantly more time than on the Mac. 
	In count 262144 in the uncontended lock, the Mac again had nice consistent benchmarks where the Windows machine spend additional time.

4.2.2
	As seen in the results for this excersise we reach almost exactly the same results as in the 'Microbrenchmarks' article, even though we reach a higher count on the 'log' test.

4.3.1
	OK
4.3.2
	OK. See file output-432.eps
4.3.3
	// TODO
4.3.4
	The performance of AtomicLong compared to LongCounter, is in my case almost exactly the same (see output-434-combined.eps). I see no mentionable performance issues. I would say, that if theres no performance issues, then one should deffinately use the built-in classes and methods, since these are well tested, and we might as well leverage the power of the framework. If I create my own stuff it's prone for error.
